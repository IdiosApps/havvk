# Havvk

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

# Testing

http://localhost:8081/
Cowboy lightweight server serves a plug. Currently returns "Hello, world!", in all envs.
Aiming for test, dev only

It starts with the rest of the app when `mix phx.server` is called.
https://medium.com/flatiron-labs/rolling-your-own-mock-server-for-testing-in-elixir-2cdb5ccdd1a0 was a very helpful starting point.

`mix test test\havvk\http_client_test`

# Dev

## Erlang, Elixir, mix setup (MacOS, Linux)

We use [rtx](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx) to keep our tooling on the compatible versions, and make installlation easier.

- [Install rtx](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx#installation). I recommend this approach:
  - `curl https://rtx.pub/install.sh | sh`
- `rtx install` will install versions in [.rtx.toml](.rtx.toml)
For now, sticking to Erlang/OTP 25 gives the best IDE experience; VS code uses a plugin with https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls, and that's best on OTP 25 for now.

The versions already in [.rtx.toml](.rtx.toml) were added with:
- `rtx local erlang@25 && rtx local elixir@1.15.4-otp-25`
We can bump minor/patch versions with:

Let's get the project ready:
- `mix local.hex --force`
- `mix do deps.get, clean, compile`

## Erlang, Elixir, mix setup (Windows)

## Running the app

`mix phx.server`


## If it's not working

```shell
mix deps.clean -all
mix deps.get
mix deps.compile
```

## Docker

[`mix phx.gen.release --docker --no-ecto`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.Release.html)

Here are some useful release commands you can run in any release environment:

    # To build a release
    mix release

    # To start your system with the Phoenix server running
    _build/dev/rel/havvk/bin/server

    # To run migrations
    _build/dev/rel/havvk/bin/migrate

Once the release is running you can connect to it remotely:

    _build/dev/rel/havvk/bin/havvk remote

- `mix phx.gen.secret`
- `docker build --build-arg SECRET_KEY_BASE="your_generated_secret_key" -t havvk .`
- `docker images`
- `docker run -p 4000:4000 havvk`
- `docker exec -it <<img-hash>> /bin/bash` if running `-d` (detached) too
