To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

# Testing

http://localhost:8081/
Cowboy lightweight server serves a plug. Currently returns "Hello, world!", in all envs.
Aiming for test, dev only

It starts with the rest of the app when `mix phx.server` is called.
https://medium.com/flatiron-labs/rolling-your-own-mock-server-for-testing-in-elixir-2cdb5ccdd1a0 was a very helpful starting point.

`mix test test\havvk\http_client_test`

# Dev

## If it's not working

```shell
mix deps.clean -all
mix deps.get
mix deps.compile
```

## Docker

[`mix phx.gen.release --docker --no-ecto`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.Release.html)

Here are some useful release commands you can run in any release environment:

    # To build a release
    mix release

    # To start your system with the Phoenix server running
    _build/dev/rel/havvk/bin/server

    # To run migrations
    _build/dev/rel/havvk/bin/migrate

Once the release is running you can connect to it remotely:

    _build/dev/rel/havvk/bin/havvk remote
